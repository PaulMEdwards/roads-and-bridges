      <span class="c1 c10">What</span>
      <span class="c1 c10"> is digital infrastructure, and how does it get built?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Earlier in this report, we compared building software to constructing a building. Those public software components are what collectively form our digital infrastructure. To understand this concept, consider how physical infrastructure works.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Everybody relies upon a number of physical infrastructure projects to facilitate our day-to-day lives. Turning our lights on, driving to work, washing dishes: we may not often think about where </span>
      <span>our water, roads or electricity </span>
      <span>come from, but we have physical infrastructure to thank. Private and public partners work together to build and maintain our transportation, sewage, water, electric</span>
      <span>,</span>
      <span> and communication systems.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Similarly, although we do not often see or think about the apps and software we use on a daily basis, all of them rely upon free and public code to function. Together, in an increasingly digital society, these open source projects make up our digital infrastructure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>However, there are several major differences between </span>
      <span>physical and digital infrastructure, which</span>
      <span> affect how the latter is built and sustained. In particular, there are differences in </span>
      <span class="c6">cost</span>
      <span>, </span>
      <span class="c6">maintenance</span>
      <span>, and </span>

    <p class="c4">
      <span>Building p</span>
      <span>hysical infrastructure is notoriously expensive. These projects are physically large in scale and can take months or years to complete.</span>

      <span>The United States federal government spent $96 billion on infrastructure projects in 2014, and state and local governments spent a combined $320 billion in the same year. Slightly less than half (43 percent) of that spend</span>
      <span>ing</span>
      <span> went towards new construction; the remainder was spent on operations and upkeep of existing infrastructure.</span>

      <span>Proposing and funding new physical infrastructure projects can be an extended political process. Transportation funding has been a contentious topic in the United States for the past decade, where the federal government faces a $16 billion shortfall for transportation funding.</span>

        <a href="appendix.xhtml#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a>
      </sup>
      <span> U.S. Congress recently passed the first multi-year transportation bill in a decade, setting aside $305B for highways, after years of political obstacles that prevented funding infrastructure from being funded more than two years at a time.</span>

      <span>Even after a new infrastructure project has been earmarked and funded, </span>
      <span>it</span>
      <span> can take years to complete, fraught with uncertainties and unforeseen obstacles. The Central Artery/Tunnel project in Boston, Massachusetts, also known as the Big Dig, took nine years from planning to initial construction. Its projected cost was $2.8 billion, with a scheduled completion date for 1998. In reality, the project ended up costing $14.6 billion and was not completed until 2007, making it the most expensive highway project in the United States.</span>

      <span>Digital infrastructure not only requires frequent maintenance and upkeep to be compatible with other software components, but its usage and adoption changes frequently as well. A bridge built in the middle of New York City will have fairly consistent and guaranteed usage, commensurate with </span>
      <span>the </span>

      <span class="c6">A lot of [our] members work in tech, either on the web or on software. As a result, they work on things that don’t last very long. Their approach is, ‘We just hacked it, and we pushed it out live,’ or ‘We just released it, and we can work out bugs later.’ A lot of infrastructure is built for 100 years. You can’t have bugs. If you do, the building will fall down. You can’t iterate it. It’s a practice that exists outside of the members’ day-to-day experience.</span>

      <span>Because digital infrastructure changes so frequently, however, older projects have a harder time finding contributors, because many developers prefer to work on new and exciting projects.

      <span class="c6">Digital infrastructure does not have a central organization to determine what gets built or used.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Finally, perhaps the most striking difference between digital and physical infrastructure, and one of the biggest challenges to its sustainability, is that there is no organizing body to determine what gets built or used in digital infrastructure.</span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Transportation, sewage and water projects are generally owned and managed by the government, whether federal, state or local. Communication and electric projects tend to be managed by private companies. In both situations, infrastructure projects are funded by a mix of private and public actors, </span>
      <span>either</span>
      <span> from the federal budget, private company financing, or metered user fees.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>

    <p class="c4">
      <span>In a stable, developed country, we rarely think about whether </span>
      <span>or how </span>
      <span>a road gets built or a building has electricity. Even for projects that are privately owned or funded, the federal government has a vested interest in guaranteeing that physical infrastructure gets built and maintained.</span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Digital infrastructure projects, on the other hand, are conceived of and built from the bottom up. It is akin to a group of citizens getting together and deciding they want to build a bridge or create their own sewage system. There is no authoritative body whose formal permission is required to create new digital infrastructure.</span>

      <span>The Internet itself does have two major governing bodies that help set standards: the Internet Engineering Task Force and World Wide Web Consortium.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) helps develop and set voluntary standards for how information gets passed around the Internet. For example, they are the reason why URLs start with “HTTP”. They are also the reason why we have IP addresses</span>
      <span>—</span>
      <span>unique identifiers assigned to your computer when it is connected to a network. Originally a working group within the United States government in 1986, the IETF became an independent, international organization in 1993.</span>
      <sup>
        <a href="appendix.xhtml#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a>
      </sup>
      <span> The IETF itself is run by volunteers, and there are no membership requirements: anyone from the public may join simply by declaring </span>
      <span>him- or herself</span>
      <span> a member.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) helps set standards for the World Wide Web. It was founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1994. The W3C tends to focus more exclusively on web pages and documents (</span>
      <span>they are, </span>
      <span>for example, the reason why web pages use HTML for basic formatting). They maintain the standards around the markup language HTML and stylesheet formatting language CSS, two basic components of any web page. The W3C’s membership is slightly more formalized, requiring an application and fee, </span>
      <span>and its</span>
      <span> members rang</span>
      <span>e</span>
      <span> from businesses to universities to individuals.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>The IETF and W3C help manage standards around the most fundamental pieces of the Internet, but the next layer up</span>
      <span>—choices about </span>
      <span>which languages are used to build software, which frameworks to build them with, or which libraries to include</span>
      <span>—</span>
      <span>are entirely self-managed in the public domain. (Certainly, many proprietary software projects, particularly those with heavy regulation, such as aeronautics or health</span>
      <span> </span>
      <span>care, may have requirements on which tools are used. They may even build proprietary tools for their own use.)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>With physical infrastructure, if the government builds a new bridge between San Francisco and Oakland, that bridge will certainly be used. Similarly, when the W3C wants to set a new standard, such as a new version of HTML, </span>
      <span>it is</span>
      <span> formally published and announced. For example, in 2014, the W3C announced HTML5, the first major revision of HTML since 1997, which had been in development for seven years.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>By contrast, when a computer scientist wants to create a new programming language, he or she is free to publish it and it may or may not be adopted. The </span>
      <span>bar for</span>
      <span> adoption is even lower for frameworks or libraries: because they are easier to build, and easier for a user to learn and implement, these tools are iterated more frequently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>More importantly, nobody is forcing or even strongly encouraging anyone to use these projects. Some projects remain more academic than practical; others are ignored completely. It is difficult to predict what gets used until others are actually using it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Developers like to point to </span>
      <span class="c6">usefulness</span>
      <span> as an indicator of whether a new project gets adopted or not. New projects should make an improvement to an existing project, or solve a chronic problem, in order to be deemed useful and worthy of adoption. When developers are asked why their project got so popular, many of them will shrug and simply say, “It was the best thing out there.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Not unlike technology startups, new digital infrastructure projects rely upon </span>
      <span class="c6">network effects</span>
      <span> for adoption. Getting a core group of developers excited, or a software company using the project, helps spread the word. A catchy name, branding</span>
      <span>,</span>
      <span> or website can add to the project’s novelty factor. A developer’s reputation within their respective community also helps determine whether a new project gets noticed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>However, in the end, a new digital infrastructure project can come from just about anywhere, </span>
      <span>which means each project is managed and sustained in very different ways.</span>

      <span class="c1 c10">How are digital infrastructure projects managed and supported?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>We’ve established that digital infrastructure is as critical to modern society as physical infrastructure. Although digital infrastructure is not subject to the high costs and political obstacles of physical infrastructure, its decentralized nature also makes it harder to pin down. Without a central governing body, how do open source projects find the support they need?</span>

      <span>The incentives for a company to maintain an open source project are numerous. Opening up a project to the public can mean less work for the company, which is essentially crowdsourcing improvements. It builds goodwill and awareness among developers, who might then be incentivized to use other company resources to build things. Having an active community of developers creates a recruiting pipeline for talent. And sometimes, open sourcing a project helps a company strengthen their user base and brand, or even drown out competition. The more market share a company can capture, even through tools it gives away, the more influential it becomes. This is not dissimilar to the “loss leader” concept of business.</span>

      <span class="c1 c10">Why do people keep contributing to these projects, when they’re not getting paid for it?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Many digital infrastructure projects are maintained by individual contributors or a community of contributors. In most cases, these contributors are not being paid directly to work on the project. Instead, they contribute for reasons that are unique to open source communities, including building reputation and a public service mindset. This section will explore some of those motivations in greater detail.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c6">Contributing to open source builds one’s reputation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Building one’s reputation is perhaps the most practical reason why someone would want to contribute to an open source project. For developers, technical writers, or others, these projects help </span>
      <span>them prove themselves</span>
      <span> in public, giving them a chance to be part of something big and useful.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Google runs a program called Google Summer of Code, which provides a summer stipend to student developers to contribute to popular open source projects. The program works well because the developers are students, new to the field of computer science, and eager to show off their skills.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Developers, in particular, leverage open source contributions to build a portfolio of their work. In addition, by providing input on popular projects with active communities, a developer has a chance to build his or her reputation by making him or herself “known</span>
      <span>.</span>
      <span>” GitHub, the website previously mentioned, is a popular platform for collaborating on code. When a developer makes a contribution to a public software project, those contributions appear in his or her profile. A developer’s GitHub profile can serve as a portfolio for software companies, but only contributions to public (i.e., open source) projects are visible to anyone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>However, reputation-based motivations also come with risks, especially among junior developers. A developer early in his or her career may contribute to an open source project for the sole purpose of getting hired, then stop contributing once this goal has been achieved. In addition, developers who are solely interested in building their portfolio may make lower quality contributions to the project that do not get accepted or even slow down the development process. Finally, if the purpose of making a public contribution is to build one’s reputation, a developer will be motivated to only contribute to popular or attractive projects (an extension of the “magpie developer” phenomenon mentioned earlier), which means that older projects struggle to find new contributors.</span>

      <span class="c6">feels obligated </span>
      <span class="c6">to support it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>A popular open source project can create dependencies for other companies, individuals or organizations. In other words, the code is being used in live software, written and deployed by other people, that could serve any number of purposes, whether online shopping or health care. This complex set of dependencies (many of which are not visible even to the project author, since they do not have clear user data) can make a maintainer feel ethically obligated to continue supporting it.</span>
